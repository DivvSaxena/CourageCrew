            <h2 class="move-head1">About Pancreatic Cancer</h2>
            <p class="move-text1">
                Pancreatic cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the cells of the pancreas, an organ located in the abdomen

            <h2 class="move-head2"> Symptoms of Pancreatic Cancer</h2>
            <p class="move-text2"> Pancreatic cancer often doesn't cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. As the disease progresses, symptoms may start to appear. Some common synptoms include:          </p>
                <ul  class="move-text3">
                    <li> Abdominal pain: Pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen or middle back is a common symptom of pancreatic cancer. </li>
                    <li>Jaundice: Yellowing of the skin and eyes, known as jaundice, can occur when the tumor blocks the bile ducts</li>
                    <li>Unexplained weight loss: Significant and unintended weight loss without changes in diet or exercise can be a sign of pancreatic cancer.</li>
                    <li>Digestive problems: Pancreatic cancer can affect digestion and cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and changes in bowel movements.</li>
                    <li>Loss of appetite: A decreased desire to eat or a feeling of early satiety can be associated with pancreatic cancer.</li>
                    <li>Fatigue: Persistent fatigue or low energy levels, even after getting enough rest.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2 class="move-head3"> Treatment</h2>
            <p class="move-text3">
                The treatment of pancreatic cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, the overall health of the patient </p>
                <ul class="move-text3">
                <li>Surgery: Surgery may be an option if the tumor is localized and has not spread to other parts of the body.</li>
                 <li>Radiation Therapy: Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. </li>
                 <li>Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body.</li>
                <li> Targeted Therapy: Targeted therapy drugs specifically target certain characteristics of cancer cells to inhibit their growth or kill them</li>
                <li> Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy stimulates the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells</li>
                <li> Clinical Trials: Participation in clinical trials may be an option for some ovarian cancer patients.</li>

                While the exact causes of pancreatic cancer are not fully understood, there are some measures you can take to potentially reduce your risk or delay the onset of pancreatic cancer. </p>
                <ul class="move-text4">
                    <li> Don't smoke or quit smoking: Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for pancreatic cancer.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a healthy weight: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.</li>
                    <li> Eat a healthy diet: Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet </li>
                    <li> Limit alcohol consumption: Excessive alcohol intake has been linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer</li>
                    <li> Manage diabetes: People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer.</li>
