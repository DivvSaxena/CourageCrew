      <h2>About Lung Cancer</h2>
      <p>The lungs are two large organs that lie above the diaphragm and under the rib cage. 
        When you breathe in, your lungs absorb oxygen and deliver it to the bloodstream, where it’s pumped throughout the body. 
        When you exhale, the lungs remove carbon dioxide, a waste gas, from the bloodstream. 
        Lung cancer interferes with this vital process and can make breathing more difficult.
        The disease is the second most common non-skin cancer among men and women in the United States, after prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. 
        A thorough and accurate cancer diagnosis is the first step in developing a lung cancer treatment plan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Symptoms of Lung Cancer</h2>
      <p>Most people with lung cancer don’t have early signs or symptoms. However, when symptoms develop, they are most likely to include:
        <ul>
        <li> A cough that persists, worsens or produces blood </li>
        <li>Chest pain </li>
        <li>Shortness of breath </li>
        <li>Wheezing </li>
        <li>Fatigue </li>
        <li>Unexplained weight loss </li>
      </ul>
        Lung cancer patients may experience chest pain that worsens with deep breathing or coughing, and have frequent lung infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia.
        
        When lung cancer spreads to other areas of the body, a process referred to as metastasis, symptoms may include bone pain, headache, weakness, numbness, jaundice or enlarged lymph nodes.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <h4> Before starting treatment, you need to identify the stage of your lung cancer. Staging tells your care team the extent of your cancer and helps decide the appropriate treatment.
      The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Knowing the type is important for staging and treatment.</h4>
      <p>Treatments for NSCLC vary by stage and may include:
        <ul>
        <li>Stage 0: This cancer hasn’t spread into lung tissue, so surgery is typically the sole treatment. </li>
        <li>Stage 1: Surgery may be the only treatment needed for this stage, although a larger section of lung may need to be removed. </li>
        <li>Stage 2: You may need surgery to remove a whole lobe of lung or the entire lung. Chemotherapy often follows surgery.</li>
        <li>Stage 3: For this stage, doctors typically order some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and targeted therapy.</li>
        <li>Stage 4: These cancers are difficult to treat, and treatment options may depend on your body’s response to the process.</li>
      </ul>
        For limited-stage SCLC, treatment may include:
        
        Chemotherapy
        Radiation therapy
        Surgery (in some cases, this may be performed before chemotherapy and radiation therapy)
        For extensive-stage SCLC, primary treatments include:
        <ul>
        <li>Chemotherapy</li>
        <li>Immunotherapy</li>
        <li>Radiation therapy</li>
        <li>Patients with either limited- or extensive-stage disease may benefit from clinical trials for new treatments.</li>
        </ul>

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>There's no sure way to prevent lung cancer, but you can reduce your risk if you:
        <ul>
        <li>Don't smoke. If you've never smoked, don't start. Talk to your children about not smoking so that they can understand how to avoid this major risk factor for lung cancer.</li>
        <li>Have the radon levels in your home checked, especially if you live in an area where radon is known to be a problem.  </li>
        <li>Eat a diet full of fruits and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Exercise most days of the week. </li>
      </ul>
